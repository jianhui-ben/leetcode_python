
#The count-and-say sequence is the sequence of integers with the first five terms as following:

#1.     1
#2.     11
#3.     21
#4.     1211
#5.     111221
#1 is read off as "one 1" or 11.
#11 is read off as "two 1s" or 21.
#21 is read off as "one 2, then one 1" or 1211.

#Given an integer n where 1 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 30, generate the nth term of the count-and-say 
#sequence. You can do so recursively, in other words from the previous member read off the digits, 
#counting the number of digits in groups of the same digit.

#Note: Each term of the sequence of integers will be represented as a string.

 

#Example 1:

#Input: 1
#Output: "1"
#Explanation: This is the base case.
